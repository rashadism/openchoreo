Create and manage a structured task list for tracking progress on complex, multi-step tasks.

## When to Use
- Complex multi-step tasks requiring 3+ distinct steps
- Non-trivial tasks requiring careful planning
- After receiving new instructions to capture requirements
- When starting work on a task (mark as in_progress BEFORE beginning)
- After completing a task (mark as completed)

## Task States
- **pending**: Task not yet started
- **in_progress**: Currently working on
- **completed**: Task finished successfully

## Task Management
- Update task status in real-time as you work
- Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing
- Only have ONE task as in_progress at a time
- Complete current tasks before starting new ones
