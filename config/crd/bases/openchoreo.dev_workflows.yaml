                  Supported template variables:
                    - ${metadata.workflowRunName} - WorkflowRun name (the execution instance)
                    - ${metadata.namespaceName} - Namespace name

                  Schema defines the developer-facing parameters that can be configured
                  when creating a WorkflowRun instance. Uses the same shorthand schema syntax
                  as ComponentType.

                  Schema format: nested maps where keys are field names and values are either
                  nested maps or type definition strings.
                  Type definition format: "type | default=value minimum=2 enum=val1,val2"

                  Example:
                    repository:
