                  Resource contains the Kubernetes resource (typically an Argo Workflow)
                  with CEL expressions enclosed in ${...} that will be evaluated at runtime.

                  Available CEL variables:
                    - ${ctx.workflowRunName} - WorkflowRun name (the execution instance)
                    - ${ctx.componentName} - Component name (if workflow is component-bound)
                    - ${ctx.projectName} - Project name (if workflow is component-bound)
                    - ${ctx.orgName} - Organization name
                    - ${ctx.timestamp} - Unix timestamp
                    - ${ctx.uuid} - Short UUID (8 chars)
                    - ${schema.*} - Developer-provided values from schema

                  Note: PE-controlled parameters should be hardcoded directly in the resource.

              schema:
                description: |-
                  Schema defines the developer-facing parameters that can be configured
                  when creating a WorkflowRun instance. Uses the same shorthand schema syntax
                  as ComponentType.

                  Schema format: nested maps where keys are field names and values are either
                  nested maps or type definition strings.
                  Type definition format: "type | default=value minimum=2 enum=[val1,val2]"

                  Example:
                    repository:
                      url: "string"
                      revision:

                  Can reference fields from the schema using CEL expressions like ${schema.repository.credentialsRef}.

                  conditions represent the current state of the Workflow resource.
                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Standard condition types include:
                  - "Available": the resource is fully functional
                  - "Progressing": the resource is being created or updated
                  - "Degraded": the resource failed to reach or maintain its desired state

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.

                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.
