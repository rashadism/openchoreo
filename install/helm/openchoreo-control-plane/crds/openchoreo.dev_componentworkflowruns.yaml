                  Tasks contains the list of workflow tasks with their execution status.
                  This provides a vendor-neutral view of the workflow steps regardless of the underlying
                  workflow engine (e.g., Argo Workflows, Tekton).
                  Tasks are ordered by their execution sequence.

                    WorkflowTask represents a single task/step in a workflow execution.
                    This provides a vendor-neutral abstraction over workflow engine-specific steps
                    (e.g., Argo Workflow nodes, Tekton TaskRuns).

                        Message provides additional details about the task status.

                        Name is the name of the task/step.
                        For Argo Workflows, this corresponds to the templateName.
